        "\n",
        "\"Think of a locker in school or a gym. Each locker has a specific number, and inside, you can store your books, clothes, or other personal items. In programming, we have something similar called variables. Just like how you'd put your book in a locker and retrieve it later, in programming, we assign data to a variable and then use that variable to recall that data whenever we need it.\"\n",

        "### **Definition and Purpose of Variables in Programming**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "In computer programming, a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "Variables serve as a fundamental concept in programming, allowing developers to:\n",
        "1. **Store Data:** Variables hold data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program.\n",
        "2. **Improve Readability:** By using descriptive variable names, code becomes more readable and understandable.\n",
        "3. **Facilitate Reuse:** Variables can be reused throughout different parts of a program, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "4. **Change Behavior:** By changing a variable's value, the behavior of a program can be altered without changing its structure.\n",

        "### **Naming Conventions and Rules**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Naming Conventions:**\n",
        "1. **Descriptive Names:** Variables should be named in a way that describes their content or use (e.g., `user_age` instead of `ua`).\n",
        "2. **Camel Case:** Used mainly in languages like Java. E.g., `userName`.\n",
        "3. **Snake Case:** Common in Python. E.g., `user_name`.\n",
        "4. **Pascal Case:** Used for class names in many languages. E.g., `UserName`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rules:**\n",
        "1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
        "2. Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.\n",
        "3. Variable names cannot be reserved words in the language (e.g., `if`, `else` in Python).\n",
        "4. Variable names should not contain spaces.\n",
        "5. Variable names are case-sensitive (`user` and `User` are different variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Assigning Values to Variables Using the Assignment Operator (=)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In most programming languages, the equals sign (`=`) is used as the assignment operator. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age = 25\n",
        "name = \"John\"\n",
        "is_student = True\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the variable `age` is assigned a value of 25, the variable `name` is given the string \"John\", and the variable `is_student` is assigned a Boolean value of `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Practice: Assign Various Values to Variables and Display Them**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task:** Create and assign values to three different variables: an integer, a string, and a boolean. Then, display them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Assigning values to variables\n",
        "my_age = 30\n",
        "my_name = \"Alice\"\n",
